# DL-Assignment-1
Repository of the first Deep Learning assignment. The task is to design a model to predict the next number in a sequence, which is the real-life dataset of a laser measurement, contained in the MatLab file.

We tried different models and merged the best one to main, i.e. the LSTM, which achieved an $R^2$ of 99%, an MAE of 1.9 and MSE of 9.7.
